# HackChallenge

Backend for Greek life event matching app on campus. We wanted to allow students to discover Greek life public events, be invited to privately hosted events, and make the rushing process easier for fraternities and sorotiies. Crafted endpoints with Flask and SQLAlchemy for student information storage and retrieval, incorporating image storage, session-based authentication, OAuth, and QR-codes for check-ins. We tested our endpoints with Postman, dockerized the project and hosted it on Google Cloud.
